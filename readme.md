# panel_data_generator

Work in progress.

## Getting started and Requirements
1. OS of Windows 7/10, I strongly recommend a 64 bit copy
2. Python 3.6.x or above [download](https://www.python.org/) (FYI, I use Python 3.6.8)
3. Clone this repo

## Installation
1. Open cmd/powershell/terimal and go inside the directory
    ```
    $ cd panel_data_generator
    ```
2. Create a virtual environtment
    ```
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    A folder called `venv` should appear inside the folder like so `panel_data_generator/venv`

3. Activate/Go into virtual environment
    ```
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Your cmd/powershell/terminal will prefixed with `(venv)`, means you are in virtual environment. Like so,

4. Install all the required packages
    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Wait until all the packages download and installation finished.
5. Check that all packages are there
    ```
    $ python3 -m pip freeze
    ```
    You should see something like this:
